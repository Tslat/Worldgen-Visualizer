# Worldgen Visualizer
 Public repo for the Worldgen Visualizer mod

Worldgen Visualizer is a Forge mod designed to help mod developers and datapack makers alike better tweak their world generation settings to their liking.
Gone are the days where every change must be checked through a full game restart, making small value changes near-impossible to quantify.

# NOTE
WG Visualizer is built for the sole intention of testing and tweaking worldgen settings. This mod should **not** be used in any standard modpack for survival or other gameplay.
By default, all world saving is disabled and any changes you make ingame will reset on logout or world restart.

## What does it do?
WG Visualizer adds a custom world type selectable from the world creation screen that loads into a custom environment.
This environment is functionally identical to a vanilla game environment, with the different that it is set up specifically to be experimented with.

Players can open a GUI in-game via the default keybinding, which gives access to all of the world generation values and settings, which can then be changed at will.
Once changed, the world will transform live in front of the player with the updated settings so you can immediately see the changes.
